# Foundations-of-Data-Science
The folder contains 3 Projects done in Jupyter Notebook related to the course Data Science. The question statement along with the jupyter notebook code with detailed report 
about the solution and analysis is in the respective folder.
#### Assignment-1:
The goal of the assignment is to find the distribution followed by the mean of coin tosses after observing the data points. 
The posterior distribution can be found by 2 different methods. <br />
a) To use all the data points at one go and calculate the posterior distribution using prior distribution and Likelihood Function.<br />
b) To use the data points sequentially and calculate the posterior distrubution using prior distribution and likelihood function.<br />
#### Assignment-2:
The goal of this assignment is to implement Linear Regression using all three methods, i.e. <br />
a) Solving by normal equations (i.e. finding inverse of design matrix) <br />
b) Gradient Descent <br />
c) Stochastic Gradient Descent<br />
#### Assignment-3:
The goal of this assignment is to implement Polynomial regression (with degrees varying from 1 2, . ., 10) using Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent backed up by Lasso and Ridge regularization.
